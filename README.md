# Excel Clone Project
The Excel Clone Project is a web-based spreadsheet application that replicates the functionality of a basic Excel-like grid interface. It allows users to perform data entry, calculations, and manage multiple sheets, offering a simplified yet interactive experience similar to Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets.

 Live Demo https://akhileshyadav7007.github.io/Excel_Clone_Project/

# Features
### Data Entry and Editing: Input, modify, and delete data in a grid-based system, mimicking a spreadsheet.
### Formulas and Calculations: Perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using simple formulas (e.g., =A1+B1).
### Multiple Sheets: Create and manage multiple sheets within a single workbook.
### Copy/Paste Functionality: Supports basic clipboard operations, enabling users to copy and paste values within the grid.
### Undo/Redo Functionality: Undo mistakes or redo actions with a simple click.
### Save and Load: Save your current work and reload it at any time.
## Responsive Design: Accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.
# Technologies Used
### HTML5: For structuring the grid and interface.
### CSS3: For layout and responsive design.
### JavaScript: For handling the spreadsheet logic, formulas, and event-based interactions.
### LocalStorage: Used for saving and loading data.
### GitHub Pages: For hosting the live demo of the project.

One-to-One Explanation of Core Logic
The core logic of the Excel Clone Project revolves around handling user interactions on a grid (spreadsheet) and processing formulas for arithmetic operations.

## 1. Creating the Grid (Spreadsheet Structure):
The spreadsheet interface is a grid created dynamically using JavaScript. Each cell can be clicked and edited by the user. The following JavaScript snippet dynamically creates a table with rows and columns.

javascript
Copy code
function createGrid(rows, cols) {
    let grid = document.querySelector('#grid');
    for (let i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
        let row = document.createElement('tr');
        for (let j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
            let cell = document.createElement('td');
            cell.setAttribute('contenteditable', 'true');  // Makes the cell editable
            row.appendChild(cell);
        }
        grid.appendChild(row);
    }
}
createGrid(): Generates a table of rows and cols using HTML table elements.
contenteditable="true": Allows each cell to be edited directly by the user.
2. Handling Cell Selection and Editing:
Each time a user clicks on a cell, they can edit its content. The application captures the cell's position and value to use it for formula calculations.

javascript
Copy code
let selectedCell = null;

document.querySelectorAll('td').forEach(cell => {
    cell.addEventListener('click', (e) => {
        selectedCell = e.target;  // Tracks the currently selected cell
    });
});
selectedCell: Stores the current cell being interacted with for easy reference.
3. Processing Formulas:
The core feature of a spreadsheet is the ability to process formulas. When a user enters a formula (e.g., =A1+B1), the app parses it, retrieves the values from the specified cells, performs the operation, and displays the result.

javascript
Copy code
function evaluateFormula(formula) {
    if (formula.startsWith('=')) {
        try {
            // Parse the formula (e.g., =A1+B1)
            let expression = formula.substring(1);
            let result = eval(expression);  // Use eval to compute the formula
            return result;
        } catch (error) {
            return 'Error';
        }
    }
    return formula;  // Return as is if it's not a formula
}
evaluateFormula(): Detects if the input starts with = (indicating a formula), evaluates it, and returns the result.
eval(expression): Used to execute the parsed formula. Note: In a production environment, avoid using eval due to security concerns and use a proper expression parser instead.
4. Handling Multiple Sheets:
Users can add new sheets, which are essentially new grids. Each sheet is stored separately, and switching between sheets allows for easy data organization.

javascript
Copy code
let sheets = [];
let activeSheetIndex = 0;

function createNewSheet() {
    let newSheet = [];  // Empty array for new sheet
    sheets.push(newSheet);
    activeSheetIndex = sheets.length - 1;  // Switch to the new sheet
    createGrid(50, 26);  // Create a new grid for the new sheet
}
sheets[]: Array storing all sheets as individual grids.
createNewSheet(): Adds a new sheet and sets it as the active one.
5. Saving and Loading Data:
To persist data across sessions, the project uses localStorage to save the current state of the spreadsheet. Users can save their work and reload it later.

javascript
Copy code
function saveSheetData() {
    localStorage.setItem('sheetData', JSON.stringify(sheets));
}

function loadSheetData() {
    let data = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('sheetData'));
    if (data) {
        sheets = data;
        // Load the first sheet
        activeSheetIndex = 0;
        createGridFromData(sheets[0]);
    }
}
saveSheetData(): Saves the entire sheet data array to localStorage.
loadSheetData(): Loads the data from localStorage and restores the last saved state.
